This is the link to the JSON server used to have the codes run. I have implemented it in 2 different ways separated by each "Main" files. 
Main2.java displays the information onto a simple GUI.

This is the contents of the db.json file.

{
	"profile":
		{"username": "jdoe", "name": "John Doe", "address": {"street1": "123 example st", "street2": null, "city": "nowhere", "state": "KS", "zip-code": "12345"}}
	
}
